**Spacious country kitchen diner with a Rayburn at the heart....**

A working Rayburn is the highlight for those colder months as you walk into the beautiful open plan kitchen, complimented by all the modern appliances

Electric hob, oven, fridge-freezer, dishwasher and washing machine.
Enjoy some country cooking in the fully equipped kitchen, and relax around the over-sized table.
Dine out in the local pub, a pleasant country walk at just over a mile away.

## Bedrooms

With 3 spacious bedrooms (2 king size and a large twin room) there is enough room to bring the extended family.
We provide a cot and highchair as well as stair gates across the top and bottom of the main flight for our younger guests.

The bedrooms all have vaulted ceilings and stunning views across to Dartmoor.

Each king size room has access to its own terrace, ideal for enjoying your morning coffee in peace, or catching up with news or planning the day ahead.

Both king rooms have direct access to a bathroom - one with it's own private en-suite shower room, and the other with a Jack and Jill door to the main bathroom.
