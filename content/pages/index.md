          Iâ€™ve stayed in many holiday cottages over the years This is by far the
          best , most comfortable and most peaceful one I have been to . WiFi is
          top notch , comfortable beds , powerful showers and I can even get
          Netflix and Amazon prime on TV . As for the garden simply amazing . I
          will most certainly be back

          Lovely rural converted barn in fabulous setting. Comfortable, home
          from home. Tastefully updated by current owners - who proved to be
          very friendly and responsive. Nice touch - the dog box availability,
          saves having to travel with ours from home. Wonderful welcome hamper
          on arrival. Great walks from the front door, not too far from fabulous
          beaches too. Perfect for our group of 6 plus family dog. We could
          imagine it being lovely and cosy in the winter too. Thank you!
